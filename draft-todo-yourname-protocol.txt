                draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv5-extension-fields-00

Abstract

   This document describes an alternative timestamp to the Monotonic
   Receive Timestamp Extension Field defined in NTP version 5 (NTPv5)
   when transferring frequency offset.  The new extension field, named
   Monotonic RAW Receive Timestamp Extension Field uses a stable clock
   source that is not affected by NTP adjustment.  It provides more
   accurate frequency-transfer offset between a remote server and local
   client, which further enhances the accuracy of time synchronization.

1.  Introduction

   NTP version 5 (NTPv5) [I-D.draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv5] introduces a
   Monotonic Receive Timestamp Extension Field to transfer frequency in
   addition to the time-transfer offset captured by the receive and
   transmit timestamps in the header.  Separation of time and frequency
   transfer using different clocks shall enhance synchronization
   accuracy.  It should be noted that when the system clock is slewed
   [RFC5905], the clock rate of the Monotonic Receive Timestamp
   Extension Field changes accordingly, i.e., clock rate diverges from
   the rate of the crystal.  This introduces additional errors when
   performing frequency transfer, hence, negatively impact the accuracy
   of clock synchronization.  This document proposes a stable clock
   source whose rate is not affected by NTP adjustment.  The Monotonic
   RAW Receive Timestamp Extension Field is recommended to faithfully
   reflect the crystal rate, despite stepping or slewing a system clock.
   In case of link asymmetry, the Monotonic RAW Transmit Timestamp
   Extension Field is recommended in addition to the Monotonic RAW
   Receive Timestamp Extension Field.  Measurements from the two
   extension fields can be used to identify link asymmetry and enhance
   time synchronization accuracy.
