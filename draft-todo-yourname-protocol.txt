           draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv5-timestamp-extension-field-00

Abstract

   This document describes an alternative timestamp to the Monotonic
   Receive Timestamp Extension Field defined in NTP version 5 (NTPv5)
   when transferring frequency offset.  The new extension field, named
   Monotonic RAW Receive Timestamp Extension Field uses a stable clock
   source that is not affected by NTP adjustment.  It provides more
   accurate frequency-transfer offset between a remote server and local
   client, which further enhances the accuracy of time synchronization.

1.  Introduction

   NTP version 5 (NTPv5) [I-D.draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv5] introduces a
   Monotonic Receive Timestamp Extension Field to transfer frequency in
   addition to the time-transfer offset captured by the receive and
   transmit timestamps in the header.  Separation of time and frequency
   transfer using different clocks shall enhance synchronization
   accuracy.  It should be noted that when the system clock is slewed
   [RFC5905], the clock rate of the Monotonic Receive Timestamp
   Extension Field changes accordingly, i.e., clock rate diverges from
   the rate of the crystal.  This introduces additional errors when
   performing frequency transfer, hence, negatively impact the accuracy
   of clock synchronization.  This document proposes a stable clock
   source whose rate is not affected by NTP adjustment.  The Monotonic
   RAW Receive Timestamp Extension Field is recommended to faithfully
   reflect the crystal rate, despite stepping or slewing a system clock.
   In case of link asymmetry, the Monotonic RAW Transmit Timestamp
   Extension Field is recommended in addition to the Monotonic RAW
   Receive Timestamp Extension Field.  Measurements from the two
   extension fields can be used to identify link asymmetry and enhance
   time synchronization accuracy.

2.1.  Terminology

   Monotonic Raw Original Timestamps (raw_org): Time of the monotonic
   raw clock at the client when the request departed for the server, in
   NTP timestamp format.

   Monotonic Raw Receive Timestamps (raw_rec): Time of the monotonic raw
   clock at the server when the request arrived from the client, in NTP
   timestamp format.

   Monotonic Raw Transmit Timestamps (raw_xmt): Time of the monotonic
   raw clock at the server when the response left for the client, in NTP
   timestamp format.

   Monotonic Raw Destination Timestamps (raw_dst): Time of the monotonic
   raw clock at the client when the reply arrived from the server, in
   NTP timestamp format.

3.  Monotonic Receive Timestamp Extension Field in NTPv5

   The Monotonic Receive Timestamp Extension Field defined in NTPv5 uses
   a different clock to transfer frequency between client and server.
   In NTP version 4 (NTPv4) [RFC5905], the clock discipline function
   defines two methods to adjust system clock, i.e., step and slew.  In
   the step mode, the clock is stepped to the correct offset.  In the
   slew mode, the clock rate is adjusted to achieve the desired offset
   during a certain amount of time.  The clock rate used to measure the
   Monotonic Receive Timestamp remains unchanged if the system clock is
   stepped, but is subject to changes if the clock is slewed, see
   Figure 1.

   Figure 1 — Impact of NTP clock adjustment on clock rate/frequency.

   In NTPv5 Use Cases and Requirements
   [I-D.ietf-ntp-ntpv5-requirements], it is recommended to adopt a
   linear and monotonic timescale when communicating time between a
   number of computers.  Stepping a clock may cause the system time to
   jump backward, making the timescale non-monotonic.  When the system
   clock is slewed, the rate of the monotonic clock source moves at the
   same speed as the system clock.  The frequency-transfer offset can no
   longer reflect the rate of the crystal, thus, introducing errors in
   frequency transfer.  In a multi-hop scenario, this effect can be
   amplified over a number of hops.  In some scenarios, it can increase
   time errors when synchronizing time, sometimes, result in a system
   that fails to converge, see Section 5.

4.  Monotonic RAW Timestamp Extension Fields

   In the Linux system, CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW is a clock source that is
   not subject to NTP adjustment, despite stepping or slewing a clock,
   see Figure 1.  It provides a stable source to calculate the
   frequency-transfer offset and reduces the error that has been
   introduced using the Monotonic Receive Timestamp extension field.

4.1.  Monotonic Raw Receive Timestamp Extension Field

   An NTPv5 message contains multiple optional extension fields.  A
   Monotonic Raw Receive Timestamp Extension Field is recommended in
   addition to the Monotonic Receive Timestamp extension field.  It is
   also recommended to derive the frequency-transfer offset from the
   Monotonic Raw Receive Timestamp Extension Field if
   CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW is available.  The Monotonic Raw Receive
   Timestamp Extension Field has the same format of the Monotonic
   Receive Timestamp Extension Field.  It complies to the constant
   length of 16 octets as defined in NTPv5.  The counter and timestamp
   are set in response.  This extension field enhances the accuracy of
   frequency-transfer function and further reduce synchronization time
   error.

4.2.  Monotonic Raw Transmit Timestamp Extension Field

   The Monotonic Raw Receive Timestamp Extension Field appears to be
   insufficient when dealing with asymmetric packet delay variation
   (PDV) on the forward and backward paths.  The same issue exists with
   the Monotonic Receive Timestamp Extension Field.  The Monotonic Raw
   Transmit Timestamp Extension Field is included to identify link
   asymmetry (i.e., different PDV on forward and backward paths) and
   reduce related errors.  The Monotonic Raw Transmit Timestamp
   Extension Field has the same format of the Monotonic Receive
   Timestamp Extension Field.

4.3.  Frequency to The Root Server Extension Field

   In NTPv5, the frequency-transfer offset is computed as the offset of
   a client relative to its immediate preceding server.  A client is
   able to synchronize with the primary server (i.e., the root server)
   only if its preceding server has synchronized its frequency with the
   primary server.  The Frequency To The Root Server Extension Field is
   an optional field that can be used to expedite the convergence speed
   when synchronizing time.  The Frequency To The Root Server Extension
   Field contains the frequency-transfer offset of a client relative to
   the Realtime clock of the primary server.  This extension field has a
   fixed length of 12 octets.  The 1-bit sign bit is a binary number
   indicates if the frequency of a client is faster (1) or slower (0)
   relative to the primary server.  The absolute frequency-transfer
   offset relative to the primary server is carried by the remaining
   31-bit.

   Assume a multi-hop scenario with n stratum levels.  The primary
   server determines the frequency offset between the Realtime clock and
   the Monotonic Raw clock, and include this value into the Frequency To
   The Root Server Extension Field.  The frequency-transfer offset of a
   server at stratum level i (2<i<=n) relative to its immediate
   preceding server is determined using the Monotonic Raw Receive
   Timestamp Extension Field (or with the Monotonic Receive Timestamp
   Extension Field if the clock is stepped).  When receiving an NTP
   message, a server at stratum level i (2<i<=n) reads the Frequency To
   The Root Server Extension Field, and adds the frequency-transfer
   offset that it computed locally to the existing value.  This way, the
   frequency-transfer offset of a server relative to the primary server
   is captured and passed down to the succeeding nodes.

   For simplicity, assume that all nodes (other than the primary server)
   have successfully learnt their frequency-transfer offset relative to
   the preceding server at time t_k.  Without the Frequency To The Root
   Server Extension Field, synchronization of a server to the primary
   server happens sequentially in time, i.e., a server with stratum
   level i needs to wait for its immediate preceding server (with
   stratum level i-1) to complete the operation of setting frequency-
   transfer offset.  Note the operation of setting frequency offset is
   decoupled with NTP message exchange.  This can take longer for the
   server at the last stratum level to synchronize with the primary
   server.  With the assist of the Frequency To The Root Server
   Extension Field, the frequency-transfer offset of a server relative
   to the primary server can be immediately passed down in an NTP
   message, allowing the succeeding nodes to synchronize their frequency
   relative to the primary server once receiving that message.

5.  Implementing the frequency transfer function with different
    timestamps

   ## Frequency transfer function assisted with the Monotonic Receive
   Timestamp Extension Field NTPv5 does not disclose details on an
   algorithm that assist the implementation of the frequency transfer
   function in conjunction with the Monotonic Receive Timestamp
   Extension Field.  One feasible implementation is to subtract the
   difference between two consecutive Monotonic Receive Timestamps from
   the difference between two consecutive Receive timestamps.  This
   gives us the amount of correction that to be applied to the time-
   transfer offset.  Once the time-transfer offset is corrected, the
   frequency-transfer offset can be derived using techniques such as
   linear regression from a number of time-transfer offset samples.
   When the system clock is stepped, the monotonic clock rate is
   unaffected.  The above function will truthfully recover the
   frequency-transfer offset from a set of measurement samples.  If the
   system clock is slewed, a client can note down the change of
   frequency over a certain amount of time.  This allows the client to
   compensate the frequency change caused by clock slew.  However, the
   Monotonic Receive Timestamp Extension Field is not able to recover
   the amount of slewed frequency in the remote server.  This introduces
   errors while estimating the frequency-transfer offset.  To the
   knowledge of the author, Chrony 4.7 release [Chrony-project] is the
   only open source implementation of the Monotonic Receive Timestamp
   extension field and the frequency transfer function defined in NTPv5.
   The performance of Chrony 4.7 in terms of frequency-transfer offset
   estimation would encounter the same issue if the system clock is
   slewed.  In a multi-hop scenario, the frequency-transfer offset
   between a server and client pair may not converge.  This will
   negatively impact the synchronization accuracy of following nodes.

5.1.  Frequency transfer function assisted with the Monotonic Raw
      Receive Timestamp Extension Field

   One approach to determine the frequency-transfer offset with the
   Monotonic Raw Timestamp Extension Field is at a client is to obtain
   the amount of offset correction that needs to be applied to the time-
   transfer offset.  This can be done by subtracting the difference
   between two consecutively Monotonic Raw receive timestamps in the
   response from the difference between two consecutively Realtime
   timestamps.  The frequency-transfer offset shall be estimated using
   techniques such as linear regression from a number of corrected time-
   transfer offset samples.  Since the Monotonic Raw receive timestamps
   is not affected by NTP adjustment.  No additional error is introduced
   if clock is slewed.  Alternatively, a client can choose to determine
   the difference between the Monotonic Raw Receive Timestamps (T2_raw)
   in the extension field and the Monotonic Raw Original Timestamps
   (T1_raw) maintained locally at the client.  The frequency-transfer
   offset can be derived with a number of computed samples using
   techniques such as linear regression, etc.

5.2.  Frequency transfer function assisted with the Monotonic Raw
      Transmit Timestamp Extension Field

   The Monotonic Raw Transmit Timestamp Extension Field should always be
   used together with the Monotonic Raw Receive Timestamp Extension
   Field to enable bi-directional measurement.  In case of link
   asymmetry, the forward and backward paths would experience different
   delay/jitter.  Thus, T2_rwaw-T1_raw demonstrates distinct different
   behavior than T3_raw-T4_raw, i.e., difference between the Monotonic
   Raw Transmit Timestamps (T3_raw) in the extension field and the
   Monotonic Raw Destination Timestamps (T4_raw) at the client.  The
   client can carefully apply a filter algorithm to take out anomalies
   on T2_raw-T1_raw and T3_raw-T4_raw respectively.  Averaging over
   T’2_raw-T’1_raw and T’3_raw-T’4_raw gives us the offset and delay of
   the monotonic raw clock of a client relative to the server. the
   superscript ’ denotes data samples that are left after applying the
   filtering mechanism(s).  The slope of the delay (or offset) derived
   from the monotonic raw timestamps would more truthfully reflect the
   true frequency-transfer offset between a server and client.
